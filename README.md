## My Process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- AD(Atomic Design) workflow
- BEM method
- sass - scss
- css
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- .JSON and DevDependence

### What I Learned

If you want to import with Sass, you need to use a dependency in your package.json:

{
  "sass": {
    "load_path": [".src/SCSS"] In this case, mi path was this; in your case, it may be different.
  }
}

### Continued Development

This project reflects most of my tools as a developer, I used learned techniques, and it reflects my acquired knowledge and my way of solving problems. I still need more practice; I am currently practicing React and I want to add it to my toolbox

### Useful Resources

- [CSS tools](https://cssgenerator.org/) - This helped me with the box shadow, making a component to use in Tailwind.
- [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) - Here you gonna learnd more about this workflow
